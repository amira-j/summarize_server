But eating too many carbohydrates — particularly the heavily refined starches found in bagels, white pasta and crackers — does our collective waistlines no favors. A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine adds to the body of evidence that cutting back on carbs, not fat, can lead to more weight loss. Researchers at Tulane University tracked two groups of dieters for one year. The participants ranged in age from their early 20s to their mid-70s and included a mix of African-Americans and Caucasians. The low-carb group, which reduced their carb consumption to about 28 percent of their daily calories, lost almost three times as much weight as the low-fat dieters who got about 40 to 45 percent of their calories from carbs. The low-fat group lost about 4 pounds, whereas the low-carb group's average weight loss was almost 12 pounds. Participants in the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories. The study showed that modest reductions in carbohydrate consumption, down to about 28 to 30 percent of diet, could help tip the scales to weight loss. The makeup of the low-carb group's diet was: 28 percent carbs 40 to 43 percent fat (twice as much poly and monounsaturated compared to saturated) about 28 percent protein The makeup of the low-fat group's diet was: 28 percent fat 40 to 45 percent carbs 28 to 32 percent protein Lydia Bazzano, one of the study authors and an associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane, says she had anticipated some difference in weight loss between the two groups. But the size of the effect — the nearly 8-pound difference in weight loss — was surprising, she says. So, what kinds of meals were the low-carb dieters eating? \"Typically in the morning they were eating eggs,\" says Bazzano. Other breakfast items included small portions of high-protein, high-fiber bread, with either butter or other kinds of oily spread. As for lunch and dinner, the low-carb dieters ate lots of vegetables, salads and protein, including fish, chicken and some red meat. They had generous portions of healthy fats such as olive oils, canola and other plant-based oils. Fat accounted for a sizable part of their diet: from 40 percent to 43 percent of their total daily calories, including about 12 percent from saturated fat. Bazzano says with so many people still abiding by low-fat recommendations, a diet so high in fat might not sound like a good weight-loss strategy. \"It's not the general perception,\" she says. But, in fact, there are a spate of studies that have come to the same conclusion about the benefits of swapping a low-fat, high-carb strategy for a pattern of eating that emphasizes healthy fats and lower carbohydrate consumption. It's not just waistlines that respond. The low-carb, healthy fats approach has been shown to cut the risk of heart disease. One big study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 30 percent, compared to a low-fat diet. Research published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which compared a low-glycemic-index diet — which minimizes refined starches — with a more traditional low-fat diet, also documented advantages. \"We saw improvements in triglycerides, [good] cholesterol, and the possibility of lower chronic inflammation\" among the lower carb group, JAMA study author David Ludwig of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital told us. Here's the fascinating part: Ludwig also found that when people stopped eating so many refined carbohydrates, they burned off about 150 more calories per day, compared to those eating a higher carb, lower fat diet. \"Too much refined carbohydrates — white bread, white rice, potato products — all the foods that crept into our diets as we've followed the low-fat craze has undermined our metabolism,\" says Ludwig. In other words, the high-carb, low-fat pattern of eating \"caused us to become hungrier and burn off fewer calories,\" he says. What's happening in the body when we follow this pattern of eating is still the subject of much research, but Ludwig says the thinking goes like this: Eating too many carbs can overstimulate the release of insulin and direct more calories into storage in the fat cells. \"It's a double-whammy for weight gain,\" Ludwig says. \"We've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body. It's a very appealing notion, but the problem is it's wrong. \"A low-carbohydrate diet is better for losing weight and may also be better for lowering the risk of heart disease than a low-fat diet, according to a new study. While low-carb diets have outperformed other diets when it comes to weight loss, some researchers feared they might be worse for heart health because they tend to be high in fat. The new study shows that with proper nutritional counseling, people can lose more weight and lower their risk factors for heart disease on a low-carbohydrate diet, said the lead author, Dr. Lydia Bazzano of Tulane University in New Orleans. \"This study shows if you are overweight and have cardiovascular disease risk factors and haven't had success on other diets, certainly a low-carbohydrate diet is worth a try,\" said Bazzano. Carbohydrates are found in food and include sugar, fiber and starches that give the body energy. Some carbs - like those in whole grains and fruits - are healthier than others - like those in white bread and other processed foods. Bazzano and her colleagues write in Annals of Internal Medicine that low-carb diets have become popular weight loss strategies in recent years. Studies on their effects on cardiovascular risk factors have produced mixed results, however. For the new study, she and her colleagues recruited 148 obese men and women between the ages of 22 and 75. None of the participants had heart disease or diabetes. Half were randomly assigned to follow a low-carbohydrate diet for a year, and the other half were assigned to a low-fat diet for a year. They were told to not change their physical activity throughout the trial. All participants attended regular meetings where they learned about portion control, healthy eating and overall nutrition. They were also offered one meal-replacement bar or shake per day. The only difference between the groups was the proportions of carbohydrate and fat in their diets. Those in the low-carbohydrate group were told to eat at no more than 40 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day. (\"Digestible carbs\" equals total carbs minus total fiber.) Those in the low-fat group were told not to get more than 30 percent of their daily energy from fat and no more than 55 percent of their daily energy from carbohydrates. Overall, about four of every five participants were still following the diets 12 months later. During that time, the researchers found, people on the low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight and more body fat than those on the low-fat diet. The difference in lost weight between the two groups would represent about eight additional pounds. Additionally, the researchers saw no increases in total cholesterol or \"bad\" LDL cholesterol between the two groups. Bazzano said that's good news since some thought a low-carbohydrate diet would increase cholesterol levels. Those in the low-carbohydrate group had lower levels of fat circulating in their blood and had lower scores on a measure often used to predict the risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. \"I thought that was a very striking finding,\" Bazzano said. She added that the score that predicts risk of future heart attacks and strokes was computed after the study was finished and is less reliable than the other risk factors they measured. Dr. David Jenkins, who wasn't involved in the study, told Reuters Health, \"This doesn’t look to me to say 'eat all the meats you want to lower your carbohydrates.' That’s just one way to do it.\" Instead, Jenkins said, people in this study appeared to improve their overall diets. For example, they were eating foods with healthier fats, such as nuts and beans. He also said they seemed to eat more fiber and cut down on processed foods with more carbohydrates. \"I think it’s another testament to what one can do with a more plant-based diet using the right macronutrient profile,\" said Jenkins of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto and the Keenan Research Centre at St. Michael's Hospital. Bazzano agreed that the overall diets improved among the participants and they were encouraged to eat healthier forms of protein like chicken, fish, nuts and beans. She also said her team is not sure why people on the low-carbohydrate diets lost more weight and had lower risk factors for heart disease after one year. It's not clear, she added,if there would still be a difference after a longer period.",
			"summary": "If you're trying to lose weight on a low-fat diet and it's not working, here's why. Refined carbohydrates—found in processed foods like white breads, white rice, and pastas—tend to be loaded with sugar, which messes with our metabolisms, making it harder to burn calories. Eating nearly half your calories via healthy fats, on the other hand—think salmon, avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils—has been shown in a recent study to result in twice as much weight loss as seen in those assigned to low-fat diets. \"It's a double-whammy for weight gain,\" one researcher tells NPR. \"We've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body. It's a very appealing notion, but the problem is it's wrong.\" What's more, the researchers say there was no increase in total or bad cholesterol between the groups, which has been feared would be the case in higher-fat diets, reports Reuters. It remains unclear precisely why people on lower-carb diets not only lost more weight but had lower heart disease risk factors. It's something the researchers say will need to be studied more and for longer than the one-year period of this investigation. (Welcome back, butter—even saturated fats might not be as bad as once thought.)",

			"text": "Herman Cain expressed confidence at Tuesday’s debate that his much-touted “9-9-9\" plan to revamp the tax code would pass Congress, but the paid campaign consultant who scored the plan for Cain said the idea was more of a theory than a politically viable solution — and not the route he would suggest himself. “You’re trying to go to a system that taxes income once and only once and quits double-taxing savings,\" Gary Robbins told POLITICO on Wednesday. “That’s something that can really juice the economy, it’s probably worth 15 percent in growth. … The problem with the big-bang changes like that, the flat tax or the fair tax, is that they are so alien to the current system that it would be a great big shock.\" Text Size - + reset 2012 field piles on 9-9-9 plan POLITICO 44 Though Robbins says the plan would work fiscally and economically, he believes people would never accept such drastic changes. Cain has repeatedly declined to name the people involved with crafting the plan besides Rich Lowrie, Cain’s chief economic adviser, a Cleveland-based wealth manager for Wells Fargo who is not a trained economist. But it was Robbins, an economist who has worked for Steve Forbes’s flat-tax campaigns and was a longtime Treasury employee, who conducted a 10-page analysis of the plan in September. Robbins found the plan to be revenue neutral, as Cain’s been trumpeting in recent debates and in interviews. “Economically, it’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with the plan and nothing wrong with the proposal,\" Robbins said. “What Cain has done is really smart and saying if you go this route, this is the way to go. He’s done a very good job and the fellows who were beating on him last night were making a mistake.\" Robbins said he’s performed various economics-related tasks for the campaign. He said he answers questions from Lowrie as recently as this week in response to a scathing Wall Street Journal editorial that picked apart the 9-9-9 plan. “They are really technical questions about how you describe things,\" Robbins said. “He wanted to make sure he was describing faithfully what was happening.\" Cain spokesman J.D. Gordon confirmed that Robbins scored the 9-9-9 plan for the campaign but declined to address other questions about him. Lowrie did not immediately respond to emails sent to his personal and campaign accounts. Robbins, who with his wife runs an Arlington operation called Fiscal Policy Associates, Inc., was once a senior fellow at the Texas-based Institute for Policy Innovation. In 2003, Jude Wanniski, who is credited with coining the phrase “supply-side economics,\" wrote in a Washington Times op-ed that Robbins is “arguably the most respected of all supply-side tax experts.\" Robbins said he served for 16 years in the Treasury Department, leaving in 1985 after working as economist in the Office of Tax Policy and for Ronald Reagan’s assistant secretary for economic affairs. He has a bachelor’s degree in math and physics from Texas Tech University and a master’s degree in economics from Southern Methodist University in Dallas. While Robbins praised the idea of 9-9-9, he took steps during an interview to distance himself from its author. “It’s not a plan that I concocted,\" Robbins said. “There’s nothing wrong with the plan, it just wouldn’t be the one I picked.\" ||||| (Toni Sandys/THE WASHINGTON POST) “9-9-9 will pass, and it is not the price of pizza because, it has been well-studied and well-developed… The problem with that analysis [that it will not raise enough revenue] is that it is incorrect. The reason it's incorrect is because they start with assumptions that we don't make. Remember, 9- 9-9 plan throws out the current tax code. ... Now, what 9-9-9 does, it expands the base. When you expand the base, we can arrive at the lowest possible rate, which is 9-9-9.\" — Herman Cain, Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, October 11, 2011 A family of four making $50,000 a year “are still going to have some money left over.\" — Cain, on MSNBC, October 12, 2011 It almost sounds like something out of the movie “Dave,\" in which the accidental president enlists his accountant friend, Murray Blum, to help him figure out the federal budget. During Tuesday’s Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza, named Rich Lowrie of Cleveland as “my lead economist\" who helped develop Cain’s signature “9-9-9\" plan for overhauling the federal tax system. “He is an economist, and he has worked in the business of wealth creation most of his career,\" Cain said. Actually, according to Lowrie’s Linked-In profile, he has a bachelor’s degree in accountancy from Case Western Reserve University, not economics. Lowrie, in an e-mail, said he did not consider himself an economist, just “senior economic advisor\" to the Cain campaign. Donor information maintained by Opensecrets.org shows he has donated $1,500 to Cain in 2010 and 2011, but also contributed $2,300 to Mitt Romney in his first run for the presidency in 2007. Okay, so Cain may have exaggerated the qualifications of his economic guru. But he has forcefully defended his ‘9-9-9’ plan, both during Tuesday night’s debate and on MSNBC’s “Daily Rundown\" on Wednesday. Many readers have asked us to examine the plan and explain it, so let’s take it for a test drive. The Facts The “9-9-9\" label is actually a bit of misnomer. Cain would toss out much of the current federal tax code and replace it, eventually and only temporarily, with three taxes — a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent business transactions tax and a 9 percent federal sales tax. On paper, the first two look like cuts, because payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare (now nearly 15 percent, including corporate contributions) would be repealed. The sales tax would be new, on top of existing state sales taxes. But note that we said the “9-9-9\" would happen eventually — and then only temporarily. That’s because it is only the second step of a planned three-step process. The first step would cut individual and corporate tax rates to a top 25 percent rate (down from a current high of 35 percent). Then the final step would replace all of the taxes — even the 9s — with a national sales tax, known by proponents as a “Fair Tax.\" (As denizens of Washington, we find this three-step process to be highly dubious. It takes years, even decades, to fundamentally overhaul the tax code. Herman Cain is going to do this three times in his presidency? But we digress.) Much attention has focused on whether Cain’s plan, in its 9-9-9 stage, would raise as much revenue as the current tax system. Bloomberg News had calculated it would collect about $2 trillion, thus falling short by about $200 billion a year. But Lowrie sent Bloomberg an analysis on Wednesday that asserted “9-9-9\" would actually collect slightly more — $2.3 trillion. We think the revenue question is beside the point. Anyone can turn the dials in their computer models to generate the assumptions they want. Michael Linden of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, for instance, estimates the plan would generate just $1.3 trillion. The biggest difference between the two estimates is that Linden thinks the 9 percent business tax would yield $112 billion a year, and Cain says he would get $862 billion — a gap that simply demonstrates how a few different assumptions can generate extremely different results. (Linden on Thursday updated his analysis, saying he had underestimated how much revenue the business tax would raise.) Cain’s proposal is so radical that it makes more sense to examine the potential impact on taxpayers. A key part of Cain’s pitch for the plan during the debate was this: “When you expand the base, we can arrive at the lowest possible rate, which is 9-9-9.\" “Expand the base\" really means that more taxpayers will pay taxes under his plan. Right now, nearly half of taxpayers don’t pay income taxes, but they do pay their share of payroll taxes, which amounts to 7.65 percent of wage income (though much of it is capped at $107,000). Cain would also eliminate the earned-income tax credit, which is intended to lift working Americans out of poverty. Many of these workers currently receive tax refunds. On top of that, Cain would introduce the new sales tax, which would affect lower and moderate-income people who spend most of their income on purchases, not savings and investments. Depending on how you do the math, people now paying zero or negative taxes might be faced with a 27 percent tax on income. In other words, while on paper Cain is promising a tax cut, in reality tens of millions of lower-income Americans would face tax increases. People in high tax brackets — 28 percent and higher — would likely see big tax cuts. (As part of his plan, Cain would also eliminate estate taxes and capital gains taxes, which, again, mostly affect higher-income people with stock and real estate investments.) There have been several interesting analyses done on the “9-9-9\" plan. Edward D. Kleinbard of the University of Southern California School of Law identifies several unusual quirks, including a “disguised one-time 9 percent tax on existing wealth — no doubt much to the surprise of Mr. Cain and his followers.\" Kleinbard, former chief of staff of the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, says that “contrary to casual impressions, the Plan could be expected to raise substantial amounts of revenue, but does so largely by skewing downwards the distribution of tax burdens when compared to current law.\" Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan administration official who now calls himself an independent, also offered a critical examination this week on the New York Times Economix blog. He (as did Kleinbard) noted that the business tax allows for no deduction for wages, which he said “is likely to raise the cost of employing workers, even with abolition of the employers’ share of the payroll tax.\" Cain, in his television appearances, glosses over such details. “The fact that we are taking out embedded taxes that are built into all of the goods and services in this country, prices will not go up,\" he asserted on MSNBC. “They will not go up.\" He then gave an example of a family of four earning $50,000. “Today, under the current system, they will pay over $10,000 in taxes assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions. I've gone through the math, $10,000. Now, with 9-9-9, they're going to pay that 9 percent personal — that 9 percent tax on their income. So that's only $4,500. They still have $5,500 left over to apply to this sales tax piece. …They are still going to have money left over.\" We’re not sure how Cain calculates that this family now pays $10,000 in taxes, but the reliable Tax Foundation calculator comes up with a much more reasonable figure: a total tax bill of $3,515 — $690 in federal income taxes and $2,825 in payroll taxes. (The family gets a big income-tax savings from the child tax credit, which Cain would eliminate.) So, in other words, under Cain’s plan, this family would instantly pay $1,000 more in income taxes. They would also pay additional sales taxes, probably more than $3,000, on their purchases. It’s unclear how the business tax would affect the family’s tax bill but it appears this theoretical family would get no tax cut but instead a 100 percent tax increase. (The picture changes somewhat if you assume that all the employer-paid payroll taxes automatically would revert to the employee. We’re not sure that’s a good bet given the design of Cain’s business tax, but pro-Cain advocates make that assumption with their own tax calculator. But even under this scenario, the family appears stuck with at least a $2,000 tax increase.) We take no position on whether it is good or bad to make the tax code less progressive. Perhaps in response to questions, Cain appears to still be tinkering with the plan. In Concord, N.H., he said on Wednesday that, among other changes, he would preserve the deduction for charitable donations and would exempt any used goods, including previously owned homes and cars, from the new 9 percent sales tax. The Pinocchio Test We can excuse Cain inflating his adviser’s resume, but his campaign needs to do more to address the fuzzy math behind his tax plan. (We asked the campaign for a copy of Lowrie’s analysis but did not receive a response. UPDATE: The documents are posted below.) Give Cain credit for thinking boldly, but he’s not talking clearly. As far as we can tell from the limited information Cain has provided, the plan he touts as a big tax cut would actually increase taxes on most Americans. Just like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, Cain’s description of the plan’s impact on working Americans is highly misleading.

The plan would replace the tax code with a 9% corporate tax, 9% income tax and 9% federal sales tax, which would amount to a big tax cut for the wealthy, who spend little of their income, but a big tax increase for most other families, since it eliminates the deductions they rely on. “Just like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, Cain’s description of the plan’s impact on working Americans is highly misleading,” Kessler concludes. The plan was dealt another blow yesterday when one of Cain’s own consultants told Politico that, contrary to Cain’s assertions in the debate, the plan was not practical, because it’s “so alien to the current system that it would be a great shock,” and that while it was a fine plan economically, it “wouldn’t be the one I picked.\"",

Robbins said he served for 16 years in the Treasury Department, leaving in 1985 after working as economist in the Office of Tax Policy and for Ronald Reagan’s assistant secretary for economic affairs . Robbins: “There's nothing wrong with the plan, it just wouldn’t be the one I picked.” Herman Cain named Rich Lowrie of Cleveland as ‘my lead economist’ in Tuesday’s debate . Lowrie has a bachelor's degree in accountancy from Case Western Reserve University, not economics . Cain has forcefully defended his ‘9-9’ plan for overhauling the federal tax system . Cain would toss out much of the current federal tax code and replace it with three new taxes . Cain would replace the current tax code with a national sales tax, known as a “Fair Tax’s” The tax code would be repealed, but it would be only the second step of a three-step process . Bloomberg News had calculated Cain's plan would collect about $2 trillion, thus falling short by about $200 billion a year . But an analysis from Bloomberg News shows it would actually collect slightly more — $2.3 trillion . Anyone can turn the dials in their computer models to generate the assumptions they want . Cain's proposal is so radical that it makes more sense to examine the potential impact on taxpayers . Right now, nearly half of taxpayers don’t pay income taxes, but they pay their share of payroll taxes . Cain would also eliminate the earned-income tax credit, which is intended to lift Americans out of poverty . On paper Cain is promising a tax cut, in reality tens of millions of lower-income Americans would face tax increases . People in high tax brackets — 28 percent and higher — would likely see big tax cuts . As part of his plan, Cain would also eliminate estate taxes and capital gains taxes . Cain: “The fact that we are taking out embedded taxes that are built into all of the goods and services in this country, prices will not go up.” He then gave an example of a family of four earning $50,000 . “Today, under the current system, they will pay over $10,000 in taxes assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions,” he said . Under Cain’s plan, this family would instantly pay $1,000 more in income taxes . They would also pay additional sales taxes, probably more than $3,000, on their purchases . It's unclear how the business tax would affect the family's tax bill, but it appears this theoretical family would get no tax cut . Cain's campaign needs to do more to address the fuzzy math behind his tax plan . Cain would preserve the deduction for charitable donations and exempt any used goods, including previously owned homes and cars, from the new 9 percent sales tax . The plan he touts as a big tax cut would actually increase taxes on most Americans, we give it three Pinocchios .",

			"self_summary": "Herman Cain plans to introduce a \"9-9-9\" tax reform which would completely replace the previous taxes. This would mean a 9% tax on income, business transactions and on federal sales taxes. Altough this might seem like a tax cut, the article calculates that this would be a massive increase for lower income families and profit mostly the wealthy. Furthermore it is difficult to judge if this reform would bring in enough money, Cain's calculations and the articles are wildly different.",

			"text": "Study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, tweeting about vaccines Bots and Russian trolls spread misinformation about vaccines on Twitter to sow division and distribute malicious content before and during the American presidential election, according to a new study. Scientists at George Washington University, in Washington DC, made the discovery while trying to improve social media communications for public health workers, researchers said. Instead, they found trolls and bots skewing online debate and upending consensus about vaccine safety. The study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, as well as marketing and malware bots, tweeting about vaccines. Russian trolls played both sides, the researchers said, tweeting pro- and anti-vaccine content in a politically charged context. “These trolls seem to be using vaccination as a wedge issue, promoting discord in American society,\" Mark Dredze, a team member and professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins, which was also involved in the study, said. “By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases. Viruses don’t respect national boundaries.\" The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, comes as Europe faces one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, one which has been partly attributed to falling vaccination rates. In the first six months of 2018, there were 41,000 cases of measles across the continent, more than in the entirety of 2017. Meanwhile, the rate of children not receiving vaccines for non-medical reasons is climbing in the US. “The vast majority of Americans believe vaccines are safe and effective, but looking at Twitter gives the impression that there is a lot of debate,\" said David Broniatowski, an assistant professor in George Washington’s School of Engineering and Applied Science. “It turns out that many anti-vaccine tweets come from accounts whose provenance is unclear. These might be bots, human users or ‘cyborgs’ – hacked accounts that are sometimes taken over by bots. Although it’s impossible to know exactly how many tweets were generated by bots and trolls, our findings suggest that a significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas.\" Russian trolls appeared to link vaccination to controversial issues in the US. Their vaccine-related content made appeals to God, or argued about race, class and animal welfare, researchers said. Often, the tweets targeted the legitimacy of the US government. “Did you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS,\" read one Russian troll tweet. Another said: “#VaccinateUS You can’t fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I’m for #vaccination!\" “Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated anti-vaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord,\" researchers concluded. “Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination.\" Measles is on the rise in Europe – and populism could be to blame | Sarah Boseley Read more Researchers examined a random sample of 1.7m tweets collected between July 2014 and September 2017 – the height of the American presidential campaign that led to Donald Trump’s victory. To identify bots, researchers compared the rate at which normal users tweeted about vaccines with the rate at which bots and trolls did so. “We started looking at the Russian trolls, because that data set became available in January,\" said Broniatowski. “One of the first things that came out was they tweet about vaccines way more often than the average Twitter user.\" Broniatowski said trolls tweeted about vaccines about 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, or about once every 550 tweets, versus every 12,000 tweets for human accounts. Researchers found different kinds of bots spread different kinds of misinformation. So-called “content polluters\" used anti-vaccine messages as bait to entice their followers to click on advertisements and links to malicious websites. The study comes as social media companies struggle to clean their houses of misinformation. In February, Twitter deleted 3,800 accounts linked to the Russian government-backed Internet Research Agency, the same group researchers at George Washington examined. In April, Facebook removed 135 accounts linked to the same organization. This week, Facebook removed another 650 fake accounts linked to Russia and Iran meant to spread misinformation. Researchers did not study Facebook, though it remains a hub of anti-vaccination activity. “To me it’s actually impressive how well-organized and sophisticated the anti-vax movement has become,\" said Dr Peter Hotez, the director of the Texas children’s hospital center for vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, and the father of an autistic child. Hotez, who maintains an active Twitter presence, said he struggled to identify whether Twitter accounts were human or bots. “There are clearly some well-known anti-vax activists that I know to look out for and I know to block or to mute, but that’s a minority,\" said Hotez. “A lot of it just seems to come out of nowhere, and I’m always surprised by that.\" Q&A What is net neutrality? Show Hide Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) treat everyone’s data equally – whether that’s an email from your mother, a bank transfer or a streamed episode of The Handmaid’s Tale. It means that ISPs don’t get to choose which data is sent more quickly, and which sites get blocked or throttled (for example, slowing the delivery of a TV show because it is streamed by a video company that competes with a subsidiary of the ISP) and who has to pay extra. For this reason, some have described net neutrality as the “first amendment of the internet\". One of the most striking findings, Broniatowski said, was an apparent attempt by Russian trolls to Astroturf a vaccine debate using the hashtag #VaccinateUS. Accounts identified as controlled by the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm backed by the Russian government, were almost exclusively responsible for content emerging under #VaccinateUS. Some of the Russian trolls even specifically used a hashtag associated with Andrew Wakefield, the discredited former physician who published fraudulent papers linking vaccines with autism, such as #Vaxxed and #CDCWhistleblower. What do Russian trolls fear most? Transparency | Paul Chadwick Read more The Guardian requested comment from Twitter and was referred to a blogpost in which the company said its “focus is increasingly on proactively identifying problematic accounts\", and that its system “identified and challenged\" more than 9.9m potential spam accounts a week in May 2018. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why has there been a measles outbreak in Europe? Social media bots and Russian trolls have been spreading disinformation about vaccines on Twitter to create social discord and distribute malware, US researchers say. Troll accounts that had attempted to influence the US election had also been tweeting about vaccines, a study says. Many posted both pro- and anti-vaccination messages to create \"false equivalency\", the study found. It examined thousands of tweets sent between 2014 and 2017. Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a \"wedge issue\", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University. \"By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases,\" he said. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said cases of measles in Europe had hit a record high, with experts blaming this surge in infections on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated. In the US, the number of children being exempted from immunisation for religious or philosophical reasons is also rising, research published in June found. While a majority of Americans believed vaccines were safe and effective, looking at Twitter gave a different impression and suggested that there was a lot of debate about the issue, the disinformation study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health, said. \"A significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas,\" said David Broniatowski from George Washington University. The researchers reviewed more than 250 tweets about vaccination from accounts linked to the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA). In February the agency was named in a US indictment over alleged election meddling. The IRA tweets used polarising language and linked vaccination to controversial statements about race, class and government legitimacy, the researchers said. One tweet casting doubt on vaccines that was cited in the study read: \"Did you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS\". Another that argued for vaccinations said: \"#VaccinateUS You can't fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I'm for #vaccination!\" Meanwhile less sophisticated \"content polluters\" - bot accounts that distribute malware, unsolicited commercial content and disruptive materials - shared anti-vaccination messages much more frequently than average Twitter users, using them as \"bait\" to get people to click on links to malicious websites. Social media companies are struggling to find ways to combat disinformation on their platforms. Earlier this week Facebook and Twitter said they had suspended or removed accounts linked to Iran and Russia over \"inauthentic\" or \"manipulating\" behaviour. In July Twitter was reported to have shut down up to 70m fake and suspicious accounts. Health cost of vaccination 'debate' Despite science overwhelmingly and indisputably advocating in favour of immunisation, a growing number of parents around the world are resisting medical advice by going their own way. Some base their decision on discredited research 20 years ago that erroneously linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) to autism. But health officials say the number of people getting the disease measles is rising because of a fall in vaccinations. In Europe more than 41,000 people were infected with measles in the first six months of 2018 - nearly double the number of cases for the whole of last year - leading to 37 deaths. High rates of measles were seen in Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia and Greece. In the US the number of children being exempted from vaccines is also rising. In Italy, the upper house of parliament has voted through legislation to abolish the law that makes vaccination mandatory for children before they start school. The amendment will mean parents of unvaccinated children will no longer face fines. ||||| “Don’t get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it.\" “Do you still treat your kids with leaves? No? And why don’t you #vaccinate them? It’s medicine!\" With messages like those, Russian internet trolls meddling in the 2016 presidential election also lashed out at Americans debating the safety of vaccines, a new study has found. But instead of picking a side, researchers said, the trolls and bots they programmed hurled insults at both pro- and anti-vaccine advocates. Their only intent, the study concluded, seemed to be to raise the level of hostility. \"You see this pattern,\" said David A. Broniatowski , a computer engineer at George Washington University and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. \"On guns, or race, these accounts take opposite sides in lots of debates. They’re about sowing discord.\"",
			"summary": "You might think twice about heading to Twitter or Facebook to read about vaccinations. \"A significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas,\" says George Washington University's David Broniatowski, author of a new study calling out Russian trolls for seeking to polarize Americans on the issue during 2016 election meddling. Already known to have stirred up issues relating to guns and race, Russia-linked Twitter accounts sent more than 250 tweets offering a pro- or anti-vaccine stance between 2014 and 2017, the BBC reports, citing the study published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. Those identified as trolls tweeted about vaccines 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, according to the study, which notes that #VaccinateUS was \"uniquely identified with Russian troll accounts associated with the [Kremlin's] Internet Research Agency,\" per the Guardian and New York Times. \"You can't fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I'm for #vaccination!\" one such tweet read. \"Don’t get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it,\" read another. \"By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases,\" says researcher Mark Dredze. But the tweets are really about sowing discord, says Broniatowski, noting that many IRA-linked tweets about vaccines also mentioned, race, class, and the US government.

Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing. When you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden).
